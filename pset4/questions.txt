0.  BMP's support up to 2^24 (16,777,216) colors, GIF's support 256 colors, 
    JPEG's support up to 2^24 (16,777,216) colors, PNG's support 2^24 (16,777,216) colors, plus transparency.
   
1.  GIFs support animation.

2.  Lossless and lossy compression are meant to indicate whether or not the original file that was
    compressed can be recovered to its original form without a loss of data once it is uncompressed.
        
3.  JPEGs are lossy compressed.

4.  The identifiers of the data are changed to signal that the target directory can be 
    repurposed. The actual data is not removed.
 
5.  I could re-write over the deleted files multiple times with random irrelevant data.

6.   <stdint.h> is a C library that provides a set of typedefs that specify exact width 
    integer types used for embedded programming.

7.  Depending on the size of the value you are trying to represent, there is a data 
    type that will allocate the memory needed to do so.
    
8.  A BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, and a WORD is 2 bytes.
  
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file have to be "0x42 0x4D" respectively.

10. bfSize is the size in bytes of the bitmap file, whereas, biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
 
11. When biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner, meaning it is not
    written upside down.
    
12. biBitCount defines the bits per pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.

13. If there is no output file to point to in memory it could return null. This could be the result of not having any
    available memory or access to it.
    
14. fread()'s third argument is always 1 because it only takes one element of data in, the BITMAPINFOHEADER.

15. The variable int padding will be assigned a value of 3.

16. The function fseek is used to move the file pointer location to a new one.

17. SEEK_CUR gives the current position of the file to the function fseek().
